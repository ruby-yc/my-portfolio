   <h2>background</h2>
   <p>Hi! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Ruby. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Queens College, City University of New York (CUNY). I started my academic journey in Taiwan, studying Food Science and Physics at Fu Jen Catholic University. After transferring to my current university, my physics background opened doors to semiconductors and coding and that's when I discovered my passion for computer science.
Moving to New York alone was a big step outside my comfort zone, but it's been incredibly rewarding. I genuinely enjoy connecting with people from different cultural backgrounds and professional fields. These conversations expose me to diverse perspectives and teach me something unique from everyone I meet. Being bilingual also helps me navigate diverse cultural and academic environments.
I'm a strong believer in the power of teamwork, especially when it comes to innovation and creativity. There's something special about bringing together different strengths—when everyone contributes what they do best, the results can be remarkable.</p>
