<h2>COIL</h2>
<p>
  Participated in a Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) project in partnership with Abdelmalek Essa√¢di University in Morocco, where students from both institutions engaged in cross-cultural teamwork, knowledge exchange, and joint problem-solving. The project emphasized global collaboration and provided valuable experience in virtual communication, intercultural competence, and international academic cooperation.

<h2>AI mask detect system</h2>
<p>Developed a web-based application capable of detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks using computer vision techniques. The system utilizes a real-time object detection model integrated into a web interface to provide instant sound feedback. In addition to the software component, I independently designed and connected the hardware setup using an Arduino microcontroller, incorporating sensors and buzzer for data input and control.</p>
